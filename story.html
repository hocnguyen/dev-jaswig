      <h2>How Jaswig was born</h2>
      <p>
        We are a group of friends that get our energy from brainstorming about new business ideas, discovering new places, networking with like-minded people, creating new insights and living responsibly. While we started working and had to sit still all day, we developed the personal need for a more flexible workspace. We believed to be active people, but sat down for more than 13h a day! We couldn’t find a standing desk that wasn’t too bulky, too expensive or looking like a transformer. Since we love to be challenged, we decided to re-invent the standing desk. Jaswig was born in November, 2014.

      <h2>Our reasons for being</h2>
      <p>
        Our furniture is made to make you feel better; it gives you more flexibility, it improves your health, and it makes you happier. Decisions we make at Jaswig are based on what will increase your health and that of the environment we live in. Health and well-being is highly determined by daily habits and we want to contribute in creating active lifestyles.

        <h2>Our team</h2>
        <p>
          Our group has formed over the course of nine years. We are travel-addicted wantrepeneurs. During our travels we fantasize about all the business opportunities we see. We started working on several of the ideas but whenever it became real, we backed out because it just didn’t feel like the right moment. The urge and motivation kept building until we thought: “That’s it!” That’s when Jaswig was born.

              <p>Less is more. Our personal need for an ergonomic work environment pushed us to re-invent the standing desk. Why the need for external energy if you are full of energy to adjust the height of the desk manually? Why the need for a huge desktop that is filled with clutter and distraction? Many iterations of designing, testing, and optimization resulted in a simple, functional desk that is compact and easily (dis)assembled.</p>

              <p>All decisions and actions at Jaswig are made consciously. We take time to understand the impact of our choices, on the people and the planet. How can we build a sustainable business with a decentralized, transparent organization and creative culture? Which materials are least environmentally polluting? What are the most efficient production processes available? Which partners have a human-centred policy? How can we make production more efficient to make our furniture more affordable? We ask questions constantly and learn daily so we can keep improving our positive impact!</p>
